## Tuesday Week 8

# Breaking the assignment into tasks.

1. Determine the API's that need to be called to complete each specified task.  

2. Determine the framework that would be best utilized to create the interface that will call the API's. (Angular Material)

3. Determine the methods and passes that will be required to:
    * Transform the user input into an API call
    * Intropolate the JSON object into usable data for the framework

4. Present the data that is pulled from the object into the UI in a way that is user friendly and pleasing to the eye.

# Group Idea

Using the restful API, and a framework that utilizes Angular, we plan on creating a user interface that calls one or multiple API's that will then be displayed based off of chosen criterea.  

# Strategy

 * Research Augur and understand whaat the API so that we can call it. 
 * Design a method/s that calls the API based off of commits and pull requests
 * Design methods that intropolates the returned JSON object and translates it into usable, readable data
 * Design a user interface that allows the calling of the API and displaying of the returned data.  
 
# In-Class Tuesday significant contribution

 * Matt helped us understand how using Angular would be the best method for calling this particular API
 * Joe helped us to understand a strategy that would be the the most efficient for calling the API
 * Tim acted as a scribe and helped translate the API so that we could understand what needed to be called and contributed to overall strategy
